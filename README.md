# RecallBridge – AI for Panic-Safe Knowledge Access

RecallBridge is an AI-powered system designed to restore access to already-known knowledge during high-pressure moments such as exams, vivas, presentations, and interviews.

## Problem
Students often prepare well but experience mental blank-outs during high-stress situations.  
This is not a learning failure, but a **stress-induced memory retrieval failure**.

Existing educational tools focus on:
- More content
- Longer explanations
- Repeated revision

These approaches fail during panic.

## Key Insight
The human brain does not fail because information is missing —  
it fails because **retrieval collapses under stress**.

Under pressure, the brain can process only:
- Ultra-short cues
- Familiar anchors
- Minimal logical entry points

## Solution Overview
RecallBridge is a **panic-safe knowledge access system** that works in two stages:

### Stage 1: Memory Anchoring
- Ultra-short recall cues (≤ 8 words)
- Minimal cognitive load
- One cue per screen
- No distractions

### Stage 2: Cognitive Question Recovery
- Activated only if recall fails
- Converts vague confusion into a precise question
- Helps unlock memory access

Question refinement is used as a **recovery mechanism**, not a chatbot feature.

## Technology Stack
- Google Gemini API – cognitive anchor generation & recall recovery
- Firebase – authentication, storage, real-time access
- Dialogflow / NLP – intent detection & question refinement
- Google Cloud Vision OCR (optional) – handwritten note processing

## Project Status
🚧 Currently under active development (Hackathon build – 3 days)

## Planned MVP
- Text input (study notes)
- Panic-safe cue generation
- Panic Mode UI
- Question recovery flow
